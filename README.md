Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my data science projects completed during my master's degree program at Baypath University. I highlight different skills and techniques including:
- Machine Learning: Model building, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
- Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations using Matplotlib, Searborn, and Plotly.
- Time Series Analysis: Working with temporal data and forecasting models.
- Outlier Detection: Identifying Anomolies in complex datasets using statistical and machine learning methods.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text analysis and language modeling.
- Geospacial Analysis: Analyzing location-based data for insights and pattern detection.

Key Skills:
- Programming: Python, SQL, R
- Data Handling: Cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- VisualizationL Storytelling through data using advanced visdualizations
- Collaboration: Experience working with cross-functional teams, executives, and business users
